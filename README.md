## React Color Picker App

This app was built as a code-along from a Udemy course.
Utilizing React and MaterialUI, the app allows users to select, create, update and save palettes of colours.
The colour palettes are very interactable and responsive.

### Future Improvements

- The app currently uses localstorage to save palettes. Authentication and user accounts along with a database would allow users to save their own palette choices
- A voting system could also be put in place to allow users to rank other users palettes
